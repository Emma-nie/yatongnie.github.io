I was a PhD student in Structural Engineering in University of New South Wales (UNSW Syndey) since 2018. My PhD research topic is short- and long-term behaviour of timber-timber composite (TTC) system. From May 2021, I joined [Digitise Consulting](https://digitiseconsulting.com/) as a graduate ditigal specialist.

Research interests: **Innovative timber structures, Finite element modelling, Deep learning**
